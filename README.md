# Compsci526_Team_Project

This project explores how **public sentiment** from news and social media influences **cryptocurrency prices**.
 We compare three models:

1. **Numerical Model** – uses historical price and volume data.
2. **Text-Based Model** – uses daily sentiment scores from crypto-related news.
3. **Hybrid Model** – combines both for improved prediction.

By applying deep learning methods like **LSTMs** and **Transformers**, we aim to identify how emotional and financial signals together affect market trends.
